"I cannot get over how gorgeous this is. You look like you belong on the cover of Vogue. Looks awesome for a Mardi Gras party!
 I LOVE this! I remember my best friend's older brothers playing this song when my best friend and I were in 5th grade. We were always singing along and her mother would always shout from the kitchen for us to stop ""singing the naked song."" Ah, so inspired!  Yes, she should make a lot. :) I really love this style! This is absolutely heart-breaking. Being a military spouse has got to ",8632437,1
"Oh God! I hate these.  I need a friend on there, man. I'm 5'8 and 155 lbs but at my lowest I was 145 and I'd like to get down to about 130. Its such a battle.

"That is awesome! Thank you for the awesome science experiment and glad you are ok! Thanks though, he already told me he wasn't going to see anyone ad we are fine and it isn't anything we can't fix with talking. He won't even go from himself. So we are pretty much in limbo right now waking for his apt and seeing what they say.

"this is gorgeous omg, and that bee? unreal I'm an ENTP woman and I do want kids, but I want to adopt. On the outside I'm feminine, but not to an extreme. In my mind, I'm much more masculine and tend to think more like the men around me than the women. I don't necessarily get along with one gender better than another, I'm equally bad at relationships with both men and women. OP, your dad sounds EXACTLY like mine. He's an ESTP.

"Alright will do Awesome thanks  I just got mine half priced on the 4th of July sale, and opened them up yesterday. They are very nice. It needs a stiff brush to pick up the shimmers, but thats pretty standard. They look the most vibrant in dim warm light in my opinion, and they look better on than in the pan. I was a little scared after I placed my order to see swatches online, but they are just right in person. I got all the greens and some of the berry colors.

 What kind of answer were you looking for? Addiction is a word thrown about without any understanding. Leave taking meth to the fictional characters in Breaking Bad. I hope you stay away from it.

I'm Chinese too, so I've always been fascinated by how similar Chinese Hanzi (汉字) and the Japanese Kanji look like. I don't want to shoot testicles all day.
