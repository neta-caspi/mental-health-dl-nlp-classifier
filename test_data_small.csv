For instance: cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2 (x)

so sin(a) = cos(2a) turns into 

sin(a) = 1 - 2sin^2 (a)

2sin(a)^2 + sin(a) = 1

sin(a)[1 + 2sin(a)] = 1

then you solve for the values of a by taking the inverse functions:

ANYWAYS, I ran this dungeon with them and they loved it. I loved running it. Up votes to you,",7019783,1
