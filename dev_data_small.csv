It took me a few years to be able to do my 1st cardiac arrest (had been in non acute settings prior to that job) and managed to get the patient back.....along side cracking a few ribs in the process! Congratulations and just take that experience forward on your career  I've kept a written record and kept my manager/ seniors involved throughout.

for having red skin... what cleanser do ya use? i have sensitive fair skin too and i had been using bad cleanser before. i tried Murad (yeah its expensive... :/ but it lasts for a long time) and it has evened out my complexion. you can get samples at sephora or ulta.

This one sounds intersting - reading the synopsis on MAL.

I have never heard of this anime. Did you find it dry at all or does it keep a solid pace? Hey, thank you! Thanks for noticing and being so nice.
Reds, oranges, and purples seem to work best, haha (: Pretty close~

Research Mirena too! The copper IUD often causes long, heavy, painful periods because it works by creating inflammation in the uterus.

The Good Times Are Killing Me

"""You're ruining your daughter. No matter what you do, your stupid shit will always be in her."" I do this with my students that are struggling. Things are hard enough and there’s so much pressure on students to finish school on time. Retaking classes because of a crisis is not what I feel the most educational outcome for students.  That's the common perception, and yes to an extent this is true. People are able to ""fake good"" on these assessments.

My goals:

Create a device that I can use for packet inject as well as man in the middle attacks. Have multiple programs on it at once. Also be able to use it as a functioning mini computer, as well as for various other task. Is this all possible? 

My other question is can I have multiple SD cards all that have a different function and just swipe them out in my pi? Thanks!",9289859,1

Either way, it's fun to watch the eggs hatch. Good luck! Think of shampoo for the scalp and conditioner for the hair. Shampoo is a cleanser, and getting to the root (haha?) of the matter is important, especially if you have concerns like dandruff, psoriasis, etc.  Conditioner is supposed to replenish the natural oils and hydration that shampoo often takes away.
