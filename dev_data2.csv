"What is your operating voltage?  The IRF830 requires a minimum Vgs between 2 V (min) and 4V (max).  It is also an NMOS device so I hope you are implementing the other circuit (Fig 3).

In the datasheet for the IRF830 Fig 1 makes me a little concerned.  With a VGS of 4.5V you are only getting (typ) 300 - 400 mA thru (pulsed mode).  Also Rds(on) is 1.5 ohms at Vgs = 10V.  Probably not a good part for this.
