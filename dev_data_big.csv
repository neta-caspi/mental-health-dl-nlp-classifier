"OP, you should look into a therapist. Medication with a therapist actually was much more effective for me. I mean, I still quit both and am back in the same boat...but that's mostly because I'm too poor to afford them now that I'm an adult.

Affordable health care my ass...

Anyway. You're not alone, and there's absolutely hope. Try again! Not every medicine is made the same, and some people really benefit from therapy as well. Good for you! Congratulations on making the incredibly difficult first step! Goo",3584476,1
"I've been going to my derm for wart removal, and burning those suckers with liquid nitrogen has done wonders. Since warts can still come back even after being zapped with nitrogen, your doctor/ derm/ whomever can also numb, scrape, and burn, which is about as pleasant as it sounds. Upside to the latter is that the wart is gone for good. After enough trial and error to deter me from attempting weight loss for at least three years, I finally caved. I was tired of feeling bloated.
